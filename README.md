## Problem
Helicopters are essential when an emergency patient needs immediate attention and transfer to a medical facility but are also a valuable commodity, so it is crucial to optimize their utilization across Upstate New York. In this report, we explore the different factors contributing to a helicopterâ€™s response time and effectiveness in facilitating the treatment of patients. Our simulation model accounts for many external variables, including whether conditions are safe for helicopter flights, severity of injury, and time for flight delay and preparation. Ultimately, we provide our recommendations for the number of helicopters to employ and at which locations across the region they should be placed based on our measures of average response time, response fraction, and utilization.
